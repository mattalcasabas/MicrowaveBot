# MicrowaveBot
A Discord bot that makes microwave noises

Exactly what it says on the tin.

Future features include:

- Custom microwave times
- Accepting food as arguments to be passed into Google's API to search for how long to microwave a specified food
- Custom power levels (higher power levels = louder microwave sound)
- Ability to interface with real world smart microwave ovens

## How do I get this working?

You'll need to make sure you have Node.js installed.

Make sure you also have `discord.js` as well as `libsodium-wrapper`.

Also be sure you fill out the token and owner ID (this can be found by enabling developer mode on Discord, then right clicking your name.) Owner ID doesn't matter right now, but there may be some functionality later down the line for this.
